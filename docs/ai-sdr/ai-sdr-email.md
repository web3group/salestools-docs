# Email Reply Handling

# Introducing AISDR by Salestools

## First Step Towards a Fully Automated AISDR: Auto Reply of Emails 24/7

Today we are launching AISDR Auto Reply in Beta, and here is how it works:

Imagine a system that replies like a human to every outbound email you send, and does so within 5 minutes? Well, that is now possible.

AISDR analyzes the reply before crafting a response. It looks for Objections, Meeting Confirmations, Not Interested messages, requests to Come Back Later, Pricing inquiries, and more before sending the reply. The system routes the response to craft the best reply for you.

### How to Prepare for AISDR

To use AISDR effectively, you need to prepare the following:

- **Your Pitch**
- **Objections**
- **Competitors**
- **Additional info** such as pricing or other relevant details

AISDR will use this information along with the email content to craft the perfect reply. You can also integrate Calendly under settings to handle meeting bookings automatically.
